				 	<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
					<p>For this lab I experimented with anonymous functions and callbacks.
						And beleive me they are definitely anonymous.
					</p>
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p> I had trouble with the second task, and figuring out how to use the setTimeout().
							It took some time figuring it out, a lot longer because I did not have
							a partner for this lab. However, I eventually got around to the problem by going to w3 and fiddling around
							there. Furthermore, the examples provided on the canvas page are also really helpful.
							Furthermore, when I was finisished with the js file and went to test the index.html file I was
							confused as to where the test functions were being printed. I then realized, and carefully read the instructions,
							that I had to open up the console in order to see them.
						</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
						<p> Go to the console, and enjoy the fruits of my labor!
