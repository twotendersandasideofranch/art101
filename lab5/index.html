					<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
					<p> For this lab, my partner and I experimented with basic JavaScript
						data types and variables.	</p>
		 			<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> I had trouble with linking my JavaScript file and my HTML together.
						It took me some time with figuring it out, like most of my programming
						problems, I needed to fix some syntax and it worked!
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p> You are currently on the index.html file I created, and below is
						the program execution. Please enjoy the fruits of my labor.
		 			<h4>Script Output</h4>
