			  	<h1>Lab 11 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
						<p>For this lab I experimented with libraries and working with jQuery, and
              it went pretty smoothly.</p>
          <div id="challenges">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p> Prior to my discussion section, I had some trouble fully understanding
              jQuery. However, after going through it in more detail with Brock and my peers,
              it made a lot more sense. It is pretty logical, and easier than the previous
              lab. I had fun with this lab!

					<h3>Problems</h3>
						<p> The only problem I ran into when doing this lab, was I could not get
              my buttons to appear on my page (when I opened it on Chrome). However,
              after reading the instructions more carefully I realized I did not
              include the the latest version of jQuery in the "head."
