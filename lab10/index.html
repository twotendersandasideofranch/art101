			  	<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
						<p>For this lab I experimented with javascript events.
						At least I tried to experiement with javascript events.
						</p>
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p> I had a lot of trouble with this particular lab. I think the not working
							with a partner has finally catched up to me. I was not able to get very far in
							this lab. I was only really able to finish Task 1, and make a button. However
							after that, I was pretty lost. I tried to consult w3 and other rsources online
							but to no avail. I tried to borrow the sort() function from Lab 7 and go from there,
							but I did not get anywhere. I don't really fully understand the event listener,
							more specifically I am just confused on how to make the event listener do the
							three functions that are required for Task 2. In order to fully grasp this concept
							I will continue reading up on resources, and continue my attempts at programming
							this lab. I am sure that if I continue working on it, I will understand and
							complete it.
						</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
						<p> There are no results, I was unable to succesfully complete the tasks at hand
							and finish this Lab.
						</p>
					<h4>Script Input</h4>
						<p>
							<label> "Please enter your name." <br>
							<input type="input" id="name-field">
							</label>
								<button id="submit-button">Submit </button>
							</p>
					<h5>Script Output</h5>
							<div id="output" class ="name"></div>
