				 	<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
					<p>For this lab I experimented with functions that take in user input and
						manipulate strings.
					</p>
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p> I screwed up in the first task, when I had to make the index page for
							this lab. I missplaced the js file and I was unable to properly link
							the js file to my index.html. After I discovered the missplaced js file
							I was able to get it linked to my index.html and I was in business. Furthermore
							I found this to be one of the more difficult Labs. I was unable to do
							any of the bonus tasks. I really need to start working with others on a
							more consistent basis.
						</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
						<p> You have probably entered your name and have seen your new and improved name.
							I hope you enjoy it!
