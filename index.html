	<h1> Introduction to Simon Wang </h1>
	<main>
		<p>Hello my name is Simon Wang, welcome to my page. I am a third year
		in the Film & Digital Media department. I grew up and live in Glendale, California,
	  just outside Los Angeles. I intend on moving up to Santa Cruz in the Spring.
		It is pretty hectic down here (in terms of Covid) and I hope things
		will chill out soon. Hopefully, we get to have in person classes in the Fall,
		but time will tell. </p>

		<p>As I wait for the possibilty of in person classes, I spend most of my time
		inside trying to stay busy. When I am not on my phone/computer, I try to catch
		up on some reading. My sister recently gave me some Greek comedies, so I have been
		diving into those. And they are entertaining, to say the least. Along with reading,
		I also try to watch some movies/television. I recently finished the docuseries,
		"How To With John Wilson" and it is the bee's knees. My movie intake has been on
		the low, only really watching the required movies I have to see for my classes.
		I'd be lying if I said that I stay home
	  all the time. I try to go on a walk, at least once a week, around my neighborhood.
	  I recently got myself a point and shoot camera, so it's been really pleasant to
	  go outside and be active. Furthermore, my friend has got me into birding so I
		have been dabbling in that recently. However it is a bit hard to get into
		when you don't have binoculars. I walked down to the LA River the other day,
		and was able to spend
	  some time with the trash and mallards. Lastly, I have been getting into fungi
	  and learning about mushrooms that are native to my area. Now I am just waiting
	  for the rain, which hopefully will entice the mushrooms to emerge from the ground.
