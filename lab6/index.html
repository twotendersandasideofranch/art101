				 	<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
					<p>For this lab I experimented with arrays and objects in JavaScript.
						They are basic data types and variables, working on the foundationals.
					</p>
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p> I had trouble with the first task, and figuring out how arrays and objects work.
							It took some time figuring it out, a lot longer because I did not have
							a partner for this lab. I eventually got around to the problem by fiddling
							around with the syntax. After adding in some commas and brackets it worked!
						</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
						<p> You are currently on the index.html file I created, and below is
							the program execution. Please enjoy the fruits of my labor.
