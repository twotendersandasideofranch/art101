			  	<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
						<p>For this lab I experimented with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
          <div id="challenges">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p>This is the most challenging lab I had to accomplish, by far.
            So hard in fact that I was unable to complete it. In the following
            section I will elaborate as to why I was unable to complete the lab.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>I had a myriad of problems in my attempt to complete this lab.
          I am having trouble with wrapping my head around AJAX. More specifically,
          how to utilize it within the code. After going back and consulting the lecture,
          and w3 I was able to have a grasp of AJAX. This allowed me to start programming.
          However I ran into trouble when using jQuery AJAX call to fetch output from
          my API. I keep on receiving a "400 (BAD REQUEST)". After a few hours of fiddling around
          with the code, going back and forth with the lecture and w3, I was still unable
          to get it to work. Essentially, my main problem concerns using AJAX to get info
          from an external source. I took a look at this upcoming lecture and it seems that
          we will continue on with API and I am not entirely looking forward to it. But hopefully
          as I am exposed to working with it more, I will further my understanding of how to
          utilize it.</p>
