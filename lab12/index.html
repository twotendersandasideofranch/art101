			  	<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
						<p>For this lab my partner and I experimented with conditionals, and
              created a function that depended on conditionals.</p>

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p> I was a bit confused at how conditionals worked, but after refering to the lecture
              and my notes it seems to make sense. Like similar labs, it is pretty logical
              and I had some fun with this lab!

					<h3>Problems</h3>
						<p> The main problem I ran into when doing this lab, was I could not get
              my CSS to link to my html page. However I realized that I had not put
              the stylesheet into the head. After I did that I was able to get it to work.
