	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> I did not have a partner for this Lab, and it definitely caused for a more
		challenging time. By not collaborating with anyone, I could only reference
		the lectures, the instructions given, and the w3 website. If I had a partner
		I would most likely have a less challenging time with this lab.

	<h3>Problems</h3>
	<p> A problem I had with this Lab was when I got to the part where I had to
		pseudocode a computer task. I did not entirely know how to start with this
		task. I chose the dice sitatuion because I did not want anything too complex.
		I was not sure how to articulate the steps for the dice roll. I eventually
		went with my gut, and decided to follow the logical steps. After getting down
		the steps, I decided to throw in some programming jargon. Furthermore, I had
		some trouble with the tags and how to use them (pre and code). But this
		was addressed in my discussion section, so that helped me out a lot.
